        This is a reimplementation of Gabriele Cirulli's excellent{' '}
        <a href="https://play2048.co/">2048</a> game, built with React, Redux
        and TypeScript. Unlike other React-based implementations, only
        functional components are used here. This project doesn't rely on canvas
        or element refs.
